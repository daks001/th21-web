## Inspiration

With the current market situation📉  and COVID-19🦠, a recession is imminent. This means a lot of people will lose jobs and a ton of companies will shut down. In these situations being financially stable💰 is necessary to survive. However, the existing systems do not teach us to be financially informed. So we created a service that teaches you the basics of finances and investing via interactive snippets 👾  and games 🎮. It even features a chatbot🤖. 
Thus, **[The Investing Space 🚀](https://theinvesting.space)** was born!

## What it does

**[The Investing Space 🚀](https://theinvesting.space)** is a web-app that helps you learn about the financial world and prepares you for it. It features interactive services 📊 that help you understand the importance of saving 🏦 and investing 🤑.

Learning and applying financial principles can be hard and scary in real life. So we made a simulation game 🕹 that allows you to experiment financially in real-life 👨🏻‍⚕️ scenarios. This is laid on top of google maps 🗺 to simulate real-life shops, jobs, banks, and such institutions to help you better understand the different scenarios that one can encounter every day.

We also feature a chatbot 🤖 that can help you understand financial terms and guide you through the website 🌎.

## How we built it

The majority of the app is HTML, CSS, JS to keep it lightweight and available at fast speeds to people around the world.

We use GCP App Engine to host the website and Domain.com for our DNS services.

The game is built on JS via web packs and other functionalities to work well on canvas.

We leverage APIs for graphing and chatbots. The chatbot also uses web-scraping to get the terms right.

## Challenges we ran into

- Getting the game working with Google Maps and Canvas using JS was hard and tiresome.

- Getting DNS transfer from Domain.com to GCP App Engine was a bit annoying due to lags and only one documentation source.

- Graphing seemed to be a challenge on the website without frameworks like React to help.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Having a working game MVP that helps us simulate real-life scenarios.

- Having interactive features that help people visualize money in a unique way.

- Having an easy-to-use and interactive UI/UX experience that makes it simple and fun for even children to learn about the financial world.

- Having a chatbot that addresses the needs of investing.

## What we learned

We learned a lot about team dynamics and how to make a functioning team. We also learned a lot about game dev and making clean yet effective websites that enhance people's understanding.

## What's next for The Investing Space

- We want the game to be fully working and support multiplayer mode so that people can play and learn with their friends.

- We want to start writing weekly blogs regarding a new financial concept to keep the website better maintained and up-to-date.

- We want to create more interactive pages that help people visualize the importance of being financially learned.
